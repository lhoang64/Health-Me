Ginger: Make a paste out of 1 teaspoon ginger powder (or 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg powder) and sufficient water, and apply this paste to forehead. Leave it on for about half an hour and then wash it off. (Note: Ginger paste can sometimes create a burning sensation on the skin. It is not dangerous, but if you begin to feel an burning sensation, wash the ginger off with warm water).
Eucalyptus: Take eucalyptus steam. Put 10 drops of eucalyptus oil in boiled water, cover your head with a towel, and inhale the steam.
Steam inhalation: Boiling fresh ginger or dried ginger powder in water and then inhaling the steam is also effective.
Hot foot bath: Hot foot baths are also beneficial. Keep legs in a tub or bucket filled with hot water at a temperature of 40˚C to 45˚C for fifteen minutes every night before retiring. This treatment should be continued for two or three weeks.
Apple: Eat a ripe apple (remove the upper rind and the inner hard portion) with a little salt every morning on an empty stomach. Take this continuously for about a week.
Cinnamon: Make a paste out of 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and sufficient water, and apply locally.
Nasal drop: Mix 1 teaspoon warm water and at least 1/8 teaspoon salt to make a concentrated solution. Put 3-4 drops of this salt water in each nostril. This helps to drain and unclog the sinuses and relieve the headache.
Spicy food: Eat spicy foods such as horseradish and hot peppers which increases the flow of blood and loosen the secretions of mucus in the sinuses.
Aloe vera: Take 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel, up to 3 times a day.
Sandalwood: Apply a paste of sandalwood to forehead.
Ghee: Put few drops of warm ghee in each nostril.
