Cool the burn: The very first thing you should do is to take immediate step to cool the burn. Hold the burned area under cold running water for at least 10 minutes. Once the burn has cooled, gently remove anything that constrict the area if it starts to swell, such as cloth, or watches. Donâ€™t try to remove clothing or material that is stuck to burned skin.
Aloe vera: Apply the gel from inside the leaf of aloe vera plant or use aloe vera cream on burn.
Aloe vera, sandalwood and turmeric: Mix 1 tablespoon aloe vera with 1/4 teaspoon each of sandalwood and turmeric and apply the paste topically.
Cilantro: Take fresh juice of cilantro by placing a handful of cilantro in the blender with about 1/3 cup of water. Strain it and take 2 teaspoons three times a day.
Vitamin E: Once the wound starts healing, break a capsule of vitamin E and pour the liquid on it. This will reduce the chance of scarring.
